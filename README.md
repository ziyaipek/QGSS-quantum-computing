## Introduction
The IBM Qiskit Global Summer School 2024 is the fifth-annual summer school program designed to refresh and sharpen the skills of industry professionals and prepare participants for the era of quantum utility. Over the course of two weeks, I had the opportunity to work on various labs, enhancing my understanding of quantum computing and its practical applications.

## Lab 1: Quantum Hardware and Quantum Circuits
In Lab 1, we focused on the fundamentals of quantum hardware and quantum circuits. The key objectives were:
- Understanding the architecture of quantum hardware
- Learning about different quantum gates and their implementations
- Designing and executing simple quantum circuits on IBM quantum processors

## Lab 2: Utility-Scale Layer Fidelity Experiment
Lab 2 involved calculating Error Per Layered Gate (EPLG) and Layer Fidelity (LF) metrics to quantify error rates in quantum circuits. Key accomplishments in this lab included:
- Utilizing IBM Qiskit Runtime with the 'ibm_kyoto' backend
- Identifying the 'ecr' gate as the relevant two-qubit gate
- Defining and working with the PATH_ANSWER list as [0, 1, 2]

## Lab 3: Quantum Error Suppression and Mitigation
In Lab 3, we explored various error suppression and mitigation techniques using the Estimator primitive. The objectives were:
- Implementing different error suppression strategies
- Using error mitigation options to improve quantum circuit performance
- Testing and analyzing the results from various combinations

## Lab 4: Simulating Nature at Utility Scale
Lab 4 focused on simulating the dynamics of a large Heisenberg spin chain. The tasks included:
- Mapping the system to quantum circuits and operators
- Optimizing quantum circuits for efficient execution
- Performing time evolution simulations and analyzing the results

## Conclusion
The IBM Qiskit Global Summer School 2024 provided a comprehensive and hands-on experience in quantum computing. Through these labs, I gained practical knowledge and skills that are crucial for the imminent era of quantum utility. This repository contains all the projects and code developed during the course, showcasing my journey and learnings in the field of quantum computing.
